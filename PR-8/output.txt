### LL(1) Conflict Detection and Parsing Table Analysis  

#### Conflict Details:  
- Ambiguities detected for **S** with terminals **a** and **c**.  

#### Predictive Parsing Table:  

| Non-Terminal | `$`  | `(`  | `)`  | `a`  | `b`  | `c`  |  
|-------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|  
| **S**       |      | **D** |      | **A B C** |      | **D** |  
| **A**       | ╬╡   | ╬╡   | ╬╡   | **a** | ╬╡   |      |  
| **B**       | ╬╡   |      | ╬╡   |      | **b** | ╬╡   |  
| **C**       |      |      |      |      |      | **c** |  
| **D**       |      | **A C** |      | **A C** |      | **A C** |  

Since conflicts exist in the parsing table, the given grammar is **not LL(1)**.
